<h1>Xavier De Moor, Citizen Developer</h1> 

<h3><u>Who am I?</u></h3>

Team work is something I value very highly, by this I mean to be able to speak your mind and give/receive feedback from the different team members. 
One of my core qualities is that I am very persistant in everything I start. I also have a high self-discipline to focus on what has to be done.
In stress situations I am able to keep a cool head and I'll also try to help others where possible. If I don't know the solution, I'll go on a hunt with them to find the solution.

#### Becode Objective
Develop my skills in backend coding further, as well getting the grasps more of the programming lannguage.

#### FearsðŸ˜°
I have a fear of failing. I know that I'm capable of a lot, but I tend to freeze when I have to present something or when I have a setback (though setbacks are the best way to learn from my mistakes).

#### Looking forward to
THe first objective I'm looking forward to, is learning how to implement everything I learned in real life scenarios and how to develop further as a developer.

#### Valued teamwork skills
1. <em>Able to speak your mind</em>
2. <b>Respect each other, laugh together and not at eachother</b>
3. <u>Use each others strenghts and help the others on unfamiliar subjects</u>
