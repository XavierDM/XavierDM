<h3><u>Who am I?</u></h3>

~~I am a 33 year old Belgian male~~ <br>
I'm a married, proud father of a daughter 👧🏻 of 2 years old. Me and my wife own two chocolate labradors🐕. I'm a Simpsons-fan, so when someone of BeCode compared me to Bart Simpson, I was flattered😎. Most of the time I'm the one giving "stupid" comments, but when it's time to be serious and start working I'm present.

#### Becode Objective
My main objective at Becode to complete the course succesfully so I can change tracks at my current employer and see the world of webdev/IT open up to me. I also hope that I learn to boost my self confidence during the course.

#### Fears😰
I have a enormous of failing. I know that I'm capable of a lot, but I tend to freeze when I have to present something or when I have a setback (though setbacks are the best way to learn from my mistakes).
#### Looking forward to
Really looking forward to get to know everyone in real life and working together on projects together.

#### Valued teamwork skills
1. <em>Able to speak your mind</em>
2. <b>Respect each other, laugh together and not at eachother</b>
3. <u>Use each others strenghts and help the others on unfamiliar subjects</u>
